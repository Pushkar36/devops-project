# 🎉 PROJECT UPDATED - NO DATABASE REQUIRED!

## ✅ Changes Made

The project has been **successfully converted** from MySQL database to **File-Based Storage**!

### What Changed:

1. **✅ NEW:** `FileStorage.java` - Handles reading/writing to file
2. **✅ UPDATED:** `StudentDAO.java` - Now uses file storage instead of database
3. **✅ REMOVED:** Database dependency (MySQL no longer needed!)

### How It Works Now:

- All student data is stored in a text file: `students_data.txt`
- File is created automatically in the project root directory
- 4 sample students are pre-loaded on first run
- No MySQL setup needed!

## 📦 Data Storage Format

**File:** `students_data.txt`

**Format:** Pipe-delimited text file
