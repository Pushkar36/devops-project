## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Java JDK** (version 8 or higher)

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

2. **Apache Maven** (version 3.6 or higher)

   ```bash
   mvn -version
   ```

3. **MySQL Server** (version 8.0 or higher)

   ```bash
   mysql --version
   ```

4. **Git** (for version control)
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-management-system.git
cd student-management-system
```

### Step 2: Create MySQL Database

Open MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench and run:

```bash
# Login to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Run the schema script
source database/schema.sql

# Or manually execute:
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
```

This will:

- Create the `student_ms` database
- Create all required tables (students, courses, enrollments, users)
- Insert sample data for testing

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

Open [src/main/java/com/college/sms/util/DBConnection.java](src/main/java/com/college/sms/util/DBConnection.java) and update:

```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_ms";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password"; // ⚠️ CHANGE THIS
```

### Step 4: Build the Project

```bash
# Clean and install dependencies
mvn clean install
```

This will:

- Download MySQL Connector dependency
- Compile all Java files
- Run tests (if any)
- Package the application

### Step 5: Test Database Connection

```bash
# Test if database connection works
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.college.sms.util.DBConnection"
```

You should see: `✅ Database Connected Successfully!`

### Step 6: Run the Application

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.college.sms.Main"
```

## 🎓 Viva Preparation

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. **Why did you use Maven?**

**Answer:** Maven automates the build process, manages dependencies (like MySQL Connector), provides a standard project structure, and simplifies project lifecycle management. It eliminates the need to manually download and configure libraries.

#### 2. **What is JDBC and why is it important?**

**Answer:** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a standard Java API that provides methods to connect Java applications with databases. It allows us to execute SQL queries, retrieve results, and perform database operations in a platform-independent way.

#### 3. **Explain the DAO Pattern used in your project.**

**Answer:** DAO (Data Access Object) pattern separates business logic from database operations. In our project:

- **Model** (Student.java) - Represents data
- **DAO** (StudentDAO.java) - Handles database operations
- **Main** (Main.java) - Handles user interaction

This makes code more maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns.

#### 4. **What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement?**

**Answer:**

- **Statement**: Used for static SQL, vulnerable to SQL injection
- **PreparedStatement**: Precompiled, prevents SQL injection, better performance for repeated queries, supports parameterized queries

Example:

```java
// Vulnerable to SQL injection
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM students WHERE roll_no = '" + rollNo + "'");

// Safe from SQL injection
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM students WHERE roll_no = ?");
pstmt.setString(1, rollNo);
```

#### 5. **What does pom.xml contain?**

**Answer:** pom.xml (Project Object Model) is Maven's configuration file. It contains:

- Project metadata (groupId, artifactId, version)
- Dependencies (MySQL connector)
- Plugins (compiler, build tools)
- Build configurations
- Java version settings

#### 6. **Explain your project workflow.**

**Answer:**

1. User selects option from console menu (Main.java)
2. Input is captured and validated
3. Student object is created from the input
4. DAO method is called with the Student object
5. DAO uses JDBC to connect to database via DBConnection
6. SQL query is executed using PreparedStatement
7. Results are returned to Main.java
8. Results are formatted and displayed to user

#### 7. **What is a Foreign Key and why did you use it?**

**Answer:** A Foreign Key establishes a relationship between two tables. In the enrollments table, `student_id` and `course_id` are foreign keys that reference the students and courses tables. This ensures referential integrity - we can't enroll a student who doesn't exist.

#### 8. **How do you prevent SQL Injection?**

**Answer:** By using PreparedStatement instead of Statement. PreparedStatement uses parameterized queries where user input is treated as data, not executable code.

#### 9. **What is Connection Pooling? (Advanced)**

**Answer:** Connection Pooling maintains a cache of database connections that can be reused. Instead of creating a new connection for each request, we reuse existing ones, improving performance. (Note: This project doesn't implement it, but it's a good topic to mention for enhancement.)

#### 10. **What challenges did you face?**

**Answer:**

- Setting up database connection initially
- Handling date format conversions between Java (LocalDate) and SQL (Date)
- Implementing proper error handling
- Ensuring proper resource cleanup (using try-with-resources)
